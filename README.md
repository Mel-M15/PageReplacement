# PageReplacement README
Please run this PageReplacement project in C++.

# Overview
This C++ program implements different page replacement algorithms in order to analyze their performance concerning the number of page faults.

# Functionality
The page replacement algorithm has the following functionality:
1. kljj



# Instructions for Execution
1. Run this program in C++.
2. There is no user input to be entered to run the program.
3. Run the program and verify that LRU, Optimal, and FIFO algorithms calculate the total number of page faults that occur. For each of the three algorithms, the program will output the number of page faults that occur during each step of the simulation.
